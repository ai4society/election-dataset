Upon verifying the voter's information, the election workers will provide the voter with their ballot(s) assigned to persons living in their district and instructions on how to cast a ballot.\nIn Nebraska, all counties use optical scan ballots; so voters are instructed to darken the oval completely, not to erase or cross out and return to the table if they have spoiled their ballot and need a new one. Ballots are tabulated at the precinct level using DS200\u2019s in 1/5 of our counties and centrally counted in larger counties using a DS450 or a DS850.",

The ExpressVote allows the voter to have all contests and candidates read to them through headphones. Or the voter can choose to enlarge the print making it easier to view.  In addition, it provides a touch screen voters may use if desired which will then print the voter's selection on the paper ballot that was issued to them by the Receiving Board. The ExpressVote prints out the paper ballot and does not record how a voter voted. The paper ballot can be reinserted into the ExpressVote where the voter's choices can be reviewed if desired. Reinserting the paper ballot does not allow the voter to change their choices. Once finished, the ballot is deposited in the ballot box with all other ballots to be counted.",

Optical Scan: With this system, you will receive a card or sheet of paper, which you take over to a private table or booth. The card has the names of the various candidates and ballot measures printed on it. With a pen or pencil you fill in a little box or circle or the space between two arrows. When you are finished filling out all the cards, you may bring the cards over to a ballot box, where poll workers will show you how to put the cards in the box. Or in some places, you may feed the completed cards or papers into a computer device that checks your card or paper right there at the polling place to make sure you have voted the way you want to and counts the votes. Direct Recording Electronic (DRE): This is the newest kind of system in use in the U.S. All the information about who and what you are voting for is on an electronic screen like a TV or computer screen. There are many variations of DREs because lots of companies are inventing new ones, and many cities, counties and states are trying them out. Usually, after you have signed in, the poll workers will give you a card that you slide into a device to start your voting session. Some of these devices will show all of the candidates and ballot choices on one big screen. Often, with these big screen devices you push a button next to the name of the candidate you want to vote for (or yes or no on a ballot measure). On other DREs, the screen is set up to show pages. On each screen or page, there will probably be one thing to vote on. For example, on one screen or page, you might vote for president. Then you might move to the next page to vote for senator. Often these small-screen devices have a touch screen, where you touch the screen next to the name of the person you want to vote for. Other devices have a key pad. And some have a keyboard, so you can write in the name of someone you want to vote for. You let the system know you are finished voting by pushing a button, touching the screen or entering something on a keypad.",
