Any automatic tabulating or electronic ballot marking system used in an election shall enable the voter to cast a vote for all offices and on all measures on which the voter is entitled to vote. No automatic tabulating, electronic ballot marking, or election voting equipment system may be connected to the internet. No ballot marking device may save or tabulate votes marked on any system. Each system shall fulfill the requirements for election assistance commission standards certification and be approved by the State Board of Elections prior to distribution and use in this state. No system may be approved unless the system fulfills the requirements as established by the State Board of Elections.

            "q": "How do I request an absentee ballot?",
            "a": "Registered South Dakota voters may request an absentee ballot by submitting an absentee ballot application form to your county auditor. State law requires absentee ballot applications to be notarized or accompanied by a copy of an acceptable photo ID to verify the identity of the applicant. Acceptable forms of identification mirror those required when voting at a polling location and include a South Dakota driver\u2019s license or non-driver ID card, passport or other picture ID issued by the United States government, tribal photo ID, or a current student photo ID issued by a South Dakota high school or postsecondary education institution.

            "q": "What happens after I submit an absentee ballot application?",
            "a": "Upon verification of registered status and completed application by your county auditor, you will be mailed an absentee ballot packet. You will mark the ballot and place the voted ballot in the enclosed return envelope. You will then sign your name on the reverse side of the return envelope. This signature will be verified against the signature on the absentee ballot application to confirm the form was completed by the same individual. Once your county auditor receives your returned absentee ballot it is recorded in the statewide voter registration list. This prevents a voter from returning an absentee ballot and voting on Election Day. Absentee ballots are not opened until Election Day. Absentee ballots are removed from the return envelopes without unfolding the ballot and immediately placed in a secure ballot box to ensure voter privacy.",

When you are finished filling out all the cards, you may bring the cards over to a ballot box, where poll workers will show you how to put the cards in the box. Or in some places, you may feed the completed cards or papers into a computer device that checks your card or paper right there at the polling place to make sure you have voted the way you want to and counts the votes. Paper Ballots: Paper ballots are one of the oldest ways of voting in America. They are still used in a few places on Election Day. When you come to the polling place, you will get a paper ballot from the poll worker. You take it to the voting booth, and use a pen or pencil to mark a box next to your candidate and issue choices. You then drop the marked ballot into a sealed ballot box. You can learn more about voting systems by checking out the Elections Assistance Commission's (EAC)",
