If you are an unaffiliated voter, you may participate in the primary of any recognized political party, or you may request a nonpartisan ballot. However, you may vote in only one party\u2019s primary.Participating in a partisan primary will not affect your status as an unaffiliated voter.

The key points are:When registering to vote, the voter should use their \u201cfixed\u201d habitation as their residence, the place where \u201cwhenever that person is absent, that person has the intention of returning.\u201dA voter who relocates temporarily with the intention of returning to their home will maintain their home residence. But if a voter intends to permanently move, that voter loses the residency at the previous address.You cannot claim two residences for voting purposes.Merely owning property or paying taxes somewhere does not establish residency for voting purposes. What matters is where the person\u2019s fixed habitation is.To vote in an election, North Carolina law requires a voter to have established the residency they are claiming at least 30 days before the date of the election. The voter registration application requires a voter to attest to having been a resident for this long prior to an election. If a person moves within 30 days of an election, they should vote based on the residence they are moving from.", "s": "SC Voter", "t": "2024-09-01 00:00:00+00:00"}, {"q": "What if I have moved within my county?", "a": "When you move within your county, you should complete an in-county change of\u00a0address.

You can also vote provisionally at your old polling place, but you may not receive a ballot with all the contests you are eligible to vote in. You can also vote at a central transfer precinct; contact your\u00a0county board of elections\u00a0for more information about this option.If you moved fewer than 30 days before the election, you must vote in your prior polling place.Please be sure to notify the board of any changes to your mailing address, if different from your residential address.

You can also check your information on the\u00a0Voter Search.", "s": "SC Voter", "t": "2024-09-01 00:00:00+00:00"}, {"q": "How does North Carolina ensure that only U.S. citizens can vote?", "a": "In North Carolina, many laws and processes work together to ensure that only qualified U.S. citizens cast ballots in elections. They include the following:The first question on the N.C. voter registration application, as required by state and federal laws, includes the following language: \u201cAre you a citizen of the United States of America? If you checked\u00a0\u2018No\u2019\u00a0in response to this citizenship question, do not submit this form. You are\u00a0not\u00a0qualified to vote.\u201dIndividuals registering to vote must sign the application, under penalty of perjury, that they are U.S. citizens. The language above the signature box states: \u201cFraudulently or falsely completing this form is a Class I felony under Chapter 163 of the N.C. General Statutes.\u201dMost N.C. voters register either in-person at NCDMV offices when they apply for other services or through the NCDMV\u2019s online voter registration application. Every first-time NCDMV customer is asked whether they are a U.S. citizen. If they answer \u201cNo,\u201d they are not offered voter registration services at the end of the transaction. To use the online voter registration service, an individual must first enter their driver\u2019s license or DMV-issued ID card number, Social Security number and date of birth. Only individuals who have been vetted previously in an NCDMV office can register or update their registration online.A new state law, which took effect July 1, 2024, requires clerks of superior court across the state to provide lists of voters who request to be excused from jury duty because they claimed they were not U.S. citizens. The State Board then compares those names with the voter rolls to determine whether any of those individuals are registered to vote. In August, court clerks provided the first set of data to the State Board, which matched them with the voter rolls. Nine individuals matched statewide. If a check of state and federal databases does not show any of those nine individuals have obtained citizenship, the State Board will send them letters informing the registrants of the agency\u2019s findings and invite them, if not U.S. citizens, to cancel their registrations to comply with the law. See page 26 of the North Carolina Voter Registration List Maintenance Guide (PDF) for more information on this effort.Specifically,\u00a0Certain acts declared felonies (N.C.G.S. \u00a7 163-275(13))\u00a0makes it a felony to register to vote or vote if a person is not a U.S. citizen.Section 1 of the application instructions accompanying the N.C. voter registration application includes language specifying that the applicant \u201cmust be a citizen of the United States.\u201d The voter registration application and instructions are available in English and Spanish.Every voter, whether they vote in person or mail an absentee ballot, must sign an application to vote on which they certify that they are U.S. citizens. Fraudulently or falsely completing that application is a Class I felony.Each voting site must include posters in English and Spanish that include the language: \u201cBy signing your voter form today, you certify: You are a U.S. citizen. Non-citizens, including lawful permanent residents (\u2018green card\u2019 holders), are not eligible to vote.\u201dAny registered voter of a county may challenge the right of any person to register in the same county if that person has a valid basis to believe the registrant is not a U.S. citizen. Please see the\u00a0Voter Challenge Procedures Guide (PDF)\u00a0for additional information.The State Board of Elections\u2019 website,\u00a0ncsbe.gov, which can be translated into 15 languages other than English using the \u201cSelect Language\u201d button on the website, contains information about voting eligibility in multiple places.As for voter registration processes, here\u2019s a VR application:\u00a0NC Voter Registration Application in English (fillable PDF). You will see that registrants must provide their date of birth and their driver\u2019s license number or the last four digits of their Social Security number. These numbers are validated against data from the Division of Motor Vehicles and/or the Social Security Administration.There is no comprehensive, accurate, or up-to-date database of U.S. citizens that election administrators could use for verification purposes. However, if election officials learn that a non-U.S. citizen registers and/or votes in an election, the Investigations Division of the State Board of Elections will investigate. If warranted by the evidence, the State Board will forward that investigation to prosecutors for review and possible prosecution at the prosecutor\u2019s discretion. Typically, there are very few, if any, cases of noncitizen registration or voting referred for prosecution statewide each year, which demonstrates how infrequent it is for noncitizens to register or vote.", "s": "SC Voter", "t": "2024-09-01 00:00:00+00:00"}, {"q": "If I don\u2019t vote, will my voter record be purged from the voter registration rolls?", "a": "Voter registration records are not \u201cpurged\u201d simply due to non-voting. Voters are removed from the voter rolls following a biennial list maintenance process mandated by federal and state law. If a county board of elections has not had any contact with a voter for a period of two federal election cycles, then the voter will be sent a forwardable address confirmation mailing. The voter will be required to return the confirmation mailing within 30 days of the mailing. If the confirmation mailing is not returned by the voter within that time, or the mailing is returned by the U.S. Postal Service as undeliverable, then the voter\u2019s record will be marked inactive in the voter registration database.Inactive voters are still registered voters. If an inactive voter presents to vote, the person will be asked to verify their address and update it if necessary. If a county board of elections has no contact (presenting to vote counts as contact) with the voter for two more federal election cycles, then the voter will be removed from the county\u2019s voter rolls and would need to re-register to vote.\u00a0List maintenance (N.C.G.S \u00a7 163-82.14).", "s": "SC Voter", "t": "2024-09-01 00:00:00+00:00"}, {"q": "How are ineligible voters removed from the voter registration rolls?", "a": "In North Carolina, county boards of elections follow a comprehensive list maintenance schedule to remove names of individuals who are no longer eligible to be registered due to death, felony conviction, moving from the county or state, or lack of voter contact.To learn more about this process, see our press release, County Boards of Elections Begin Regular Voter List Maintenance Processes.", "s": "SC Voter", "t": "2024-09-01 00:00:00+00:00"}, {"q": "May I keep my voter registration information private?", "a": "Pursuant to Official record of voter registration (N.C.G.S. \u00a7 163-82.10) and Public records (Chapter 132 of the General Statutes), the State Board of Elections is required to make most voter information available to the public.

All the information about who and what you are voting for is on an electronic screen, like a TV or computer screen. The poll workers will give you a card that you slide into a device to start your voting session. These devices will show all of the candidates and ballot choices on one big screen. Often, with these bigscreen devices you push a button next to the name of the candidate you want to votefor (or yes or no on a ballot measure). On each screen or page, there will probably be one thing to vote on. For example, on one screen or page, you might vote for president. Then you might move to the next page to vote for senator.

Some of these machinese have a key pad, and/ or have a keyboard, so you can write in the name of someone you want to vote for. You let the system know you are finished voting by pushing a button, touching the screen or entering something on a keypad. The votes are stored on a computer device like a disk or a cartridge. At the end of the day, results from the disk or cartridge can be printed and read at the polling place or transferred to a central location.
