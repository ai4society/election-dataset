            "a": "All Missouri voters must show acceptable identification and sign the poll book to obtain their ballot. Acceptable forms of ID include: A nonexpired Missouri driver or non-driver license; A nonexpired [or unexpiring] military ID, including a veteran\u2019s ID card; A nonexpired United States passport; or Another photo ID issued by the United States or the state of Missouri which is either not expired or expired after the date of the most recent general election.* *If the driver or non-driver license has expired after the most recent general election, it is an acceptable form of voter ID. If you do not have an acceptable photo ID, you may be eligible for a free MO nondriver license for voting purposes. The Missouri Department of Revenue may provide 1 free nondriver license to all Missourians. For more information call 573-526-VOTE or visit https://dor.mo.gov/. You can also request help from the Secretary of State through this form. If you do not possess any of these forms of identification, but are a registered voter, you may cast a provisional ballot.",

If your name does not appear on the poll book and you are eligible to vote at that precinct, you may also receive a provisional ballot. Every effort will be made to determine your eligibility and your correct polling place so you can cast a regular ballot. Provisional Ballots are counted two weeks after the election.

            "a": "There are multiple options available for voters who require accessible methods to cast their votes. It is up to the voter to decide which method is best suited for them. Election officials cannot make this decision for you, and your ballot will remain anonymous no matter which method you choose. Absentee voting by mail is an option available to Missouri voters who are unable to vote in person due to illness or disability. If you qualify, you can request an absentee ballot application that doesn\u2019t require notarization. The deadline for submitting the application is 5 p.m. on the 2nd Wednesday prior to the election. If you have a permanent disability, you can request to be included in a list of voters who automatically receive an absentee ballot application before each election. You can contact your local election officials to learn more about this option. Accessible voting machines are available to accommodate voters with different needs, including those with print disabilities. If you require an accessible voting machine, inform the election officials as soon as you arrive at the polling place to allow them time to set it up for you. The accessible voting machine offers multiple features to cater to different needs. If you are blind, you can choose to have the ballot read out loud to you through a human-sounding voice using a set of headphones available at the polling station. If you prefer, you can bring your own headset. If you have limited vision, you can elect to view the ballot in larger print without the need for a magnifier. If you have a learning disability or an intellectual disability, accessible voting machines offer features that may help you. If you have limited use of your hands, the voting machine has easy-to-use knobs and buttons. If you require assistance in marking your ballot, you can bring someone of your choice who is at least 18 years old to help you in the voting booth. If you don't have anyone available, two election officials (one Democrat and one Republican) can assist you. Curbside voting is an option for voters who are unable to enter the polling location due to health limitations. Election officials can bring the ballot to your car in a clearly marked driving lane/parking spot. If you are in the City of St. Louis, you can use a doorbell to alert officials that you need curbside voting. In St. Louis County, you can follow a sign to request your ballot or ask someone to alert a poll worker. All polling locations are required to have wheelchair-accessible voting booths. For more information, you can utilize the American Association of People With Disabilities (AAPD) resource.",

            "a": "A new election law (HB1878) requires that local election authorities be able to count and audit paper ballots. Local election authorities will not be able to use direct-recording electronic vote-counting machines after Jan. 1, 2024. The voting systems used in Missouri are optical scan and punch card. Optical Scan: With this system, you will receive a card or sheet of paper, which you take over to a private table or booth. The card has the names of the various candidates and ballot measures printed on it. With a pen or pencil you fill in a little box or circle or the space between two arrows. When you are finished filling out all the cards, you may bring the cards over to a ballot box, where poll workers will show you how to put the cards in the box. Or in some places, you may feed the completed cards or papers into a computer device that checks your card or paper right there at the polling place to make sure you have voted the way you want to and counts the votes. Punchcards: With a punchcard system, when you sign in at the polling place, the poll workers will give you one or more cards. These cards are usually about 8 inches by 3 inches, with small rectangles that can be punched out. You take your cards to a small private table. You'll see a booklet mounted on a frame. The frame will have a place for you to slide your first card in. Make sure that it's in all the way and lined up correctly. If you're not sure, ask one of the poll workers to make sure you've got it right. The table also has a little device (often a metal stylus or stick) that you use to punch holes next to the name of the person or ballot measure you want to vote for. Give it a firm punch, so it pushes out that little cardboard rectangle or chad. You may have to look at the booklet carefully so that you punch the right hole lined up with the person you want to vote for. Often there is a little arrow that helps you find the right hole. Some punchcards have the names of the candidates written right on the cards. You may need to vote on more than one card. Look it over carefully, so you put the right card in the right slot. Some punch card systems use both sides of the card, so look on the back of each card too. Check to see that all the holes are punched all the way through and there are no little pieces of cardboard (chad) hanging from your card. When you are done, pick up all your cards. There may be an envelope to put your cards in. Take your cards over to the ballot box and put the cards into the box.",
