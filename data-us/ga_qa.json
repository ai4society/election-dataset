The provisional ballot will count if the problem is solved within three days after Election Day. NOTE: Due to a recent change, out-of-precinct provisional ballots will not count anymore unless cast after 5 p.m. and a voter signs a statement saying they could not make it to their home precinct in time. The three reasons for voting a provisional ballot are: (1)You are unable to show the required forms of photo ID when you vote in person (2)When you first registered to vote in Georgia you registered by mail, did not provide any identification at the time and are unable to present acceptable identification the first time you vote in person (3)Your name does not appear on the list of registered voters in the precinct (4)If you have a good faith belief you are properly registered in your county. If you vote a provisional ballot because you did not have acceptable identification, you will have three days from the close of the polls to present acceptable identification to your county registrar office for your vote to count.",

            "q": "What assistance is available at the polls for voters who have difficulties reading English or have physical disabilities?",
            "a": "You may receive assistance at the polls if you are unable to read the English language or if you have a physical disability that renders you unable to see or mark the ballot, operate the voting equipment, or enter the voting booth. In order to receive assistance, everyone, except those that are blind, must take an oath stating the reason they need assistance. The person providing assistance to you must sign on the oath. When there is a federal candidate on the ballot, you can select anyone you want to assist you in voting, except for your employer, an agent of that employer, or an officer or agent of your union. When there is no federal candidate on the ballot, you can select any other resident of the precinct or a parent, sibling, spouse or child (provided they are not a candidate on the ballot or a relative of a candidate on the ballot) to assist you inside the voting booth. No person may assist more than ten voters in a primary, election, or runoff. Note: Between the hours of 9:30 am and 4:30 pm on the day of an election, voters who are 75 years of age or older or who are physically disabled may, upon request to a poll officer, vote immediately without waiting in line. Adaptive Voting Machines are available that voters can use to navigate through the ballot and make their selections\u2014 a hand-held controller called the Audio Tactile Interface (ATI), sip and puff device, or paddle device.",
