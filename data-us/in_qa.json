            "q": "What is a provisional ballot?",
            "a": "There are several situations in which you may be required to cast a provisional ballot as a voter: You lack the requisite photo identification. Your name appears on the poll list, but you have been challenged as not eligible to vote at the precinct for some other reason sworn to in writing by the person who challenges your eligibility to vote. An order has been issued by a court extending the hours that the polls must remain open. A provisional ballot allows you to cast a vote if: There is a question about your qualification to vote in the precinct (for example, you are not on the poll book), which is not resolved by a fail-safe procedure and you believe you are qualified to vote in the precinct; or You have been challenged as not qualified to vote in your precinct (for example, you did not have photo identification). A person may not challenge the right of an individual to vote at an election in the precinct solely on the basis of the individuals: Enrollment in an educational institution; or Being adjudged mentally ill and committed to an institution; or Registration to vote at an address that is housing provided for students by the educational institution. Actual or perceived affiliation with a political party; or Support or opposition to a candidate or the adoption of a public question. Your provisional ballot will be kept separate from the other ballots cast in that precinct. After Election Day, the county election board will decide whether you were qualified to vote in that precinct and whether your ballot should be counted. Voters CANNOT cast a provisional ballot on a direct record electronic voting system; a provisional ballot must be cast on a traditional hand-counted paper ballot or an optical scan ballot card, which is then secured in a PRE-4/PRO-2 envelope for the county election board to review at a provisional ballot hearing. If you cast a provisional ballot, you have until noon, ten (10) days after the election to follow up with the county election board and either provide the necessary documentation or complete an affidavit available in the clerks office to affirm one of the photo ID laws exemptions applies to you. You will be able to contact your county election board after Election Day to find out whether your ballot was counted, and if it was not counted, why not. This information can also be found on the voters portal page after logging in to indianavoters.com, if you are a registered voter of the county where you cast your provisional ballot.",

If you lost your voting rights because of a conviction, you could register to vote immediately after release. Your voting rights are not restricted by pretrial detention, misdemeanors, probation, or parole. Voters without traditional residence: Voters in Indiana with non-traditional residences, including those experiencing homelessness or those who live in motor homes, are still required to provide a sufficient location for local election officials to assign them to a precinct. If the person stays in multiple places, they should indicate the location where they usually sleep in the county when registering to vote. If the location lacks a street address, the person can provide a description or draw a map of their residence on an attached paper along with the state's voter registration form. Additionally, individuals with non-traditional residences must provide a mailing address within their county. Note: While a post office box can be used as a mailing address, it cannot serve as the residence address for determining the voting precinct. The county will process the application and send the acknowledgment card or notice of disposition (in case of rejection) to the provided mailing address.",

            "a": "The voting machine systems used in Indiana are optical scan and DRE. Optical Scan: With this system, you will receive a card or sheet of paper, which you take over to a private table or booth. The card has the names of the various candidates and ballot measures printed on it. With a pen or pencil you fill in a little box or circle or the space between two arrows. When you are finished filling out all the cards, you may bring the cards over to a ballot box, where poll workers will show you how to put the cards in the box. Or in some places, you may feed the completed cards or papers into a computer device that checks your card or paper right there at the polling place to make sure you have voted the way you want to and counts the votes. Direct Recording Electronic (DRE): This is the newest kind of system in use in the U.S. All the information about who and what you are voting for is on an electronic screen like a TV or computer screen. There are many variations of DREs because lots of companies are inventing new ones, and many cities, counties and states are trying them out. Usually, after you have signed in, the poll workers will give you a card that you slide into a device to start your voting session. Some of these devices will show all of the candidates and ballot choices on one big screen. Often, with these big screen devices you push a button next to the name of the candidate you want to vote for (or yes or no on a ballot measure). On other DREs, the screen is set up to show pages. On each screen or page, there will probably be one thing to vote on. For example, on one screen or page, you might vote for president. Then you might move to the next page to vote for senator. Often these small-screen devices have a touch screen, where you touch the screen next to the name of the person you want to vote for. Other devices have a key pad. Some have a keyboard, so you can write in the name of someone you want to vote for. You let the system know you are finished voting by pushing a button, touching the screen or entering something on a keypad. You can learn more about voting systems by checking out the Elections Assistance Commission's (EAC) resource or through Verified Voting .",
