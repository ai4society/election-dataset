            "a": "The voting system used in South Carolina is a paper-based voting system.\n Paper-Based Voting System: After signing in at your polling place, voters are given a blank ballot card to insert into the voting machine. Voters then make their selections by touching the screen on the voting machine. After completing the last page, hit the \"next\" button on the machine to review your selections. You can change a selection at this time, or move forward with the process by clicking \"next.\" \n Once you are done making your selections, print your ballot by pressing the PRINT CARD icon found at the bottom of the voting machine screen. Review the printed ballot card - if you need to make a change to the card you can contact a poll manager to ask for a replacement. When you're ready to cast your ballot, take the ballot card to the scanner and insert it face down on the green arrow. The scanner counts your vote and places the paper ballot into a locked ballot box.\n For more information, please contact the South Carolina Election Commission.\n \n\n \n\n (https://scvotes.gov/voters/how-to-vote/)\n (https://scvotes.gov/voters/how-to-vote/)",
