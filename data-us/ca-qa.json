            "Answer": "if you are already registered to vote in california and have moved or changed your name, you may update your voter registration by: re-registering online or by submitting a paper voter registration application.\n sending a signed letter to your current county elections official, even if it is in a different county, informing them of your move and providing them with your date of birth and current address.\n if you have recently updated your address at the dmv or usps, your voter registration will be automatically updated.",
