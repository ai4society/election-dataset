            "a": "No. The Department of State has confidence in the security of Pennsylvania's election process and mail ballot system. Additional Details: Each mail ballot packet sent to a voter has a unique ID number. That same number is also printed on the pre-addressed outer return envelope where the voter must sign. When either type of mail ballot (absentee or no-excuse mail-in) is received and pre-canvassed, the unique ID number is scanned into the statewide system. To issue a second ballot to a voter, the county must first cancel the ballot initially issued to the voter. In other words, each voter can receive only one ballot.\u00a0If a voter attempts to vote a second ballot, the system will flag that there is already a ballot from that voter. If a voter returns a mail ballot, their record is marked, and that notation is included in the poll book to ensure that poll workers are aware that the voter's ballot has been cast. The department also updated the poll book format to move the names of voters who have returned their ballots to a separate list at the end of the poll book. Those voters can only vote at a polling place by means of a provisional ballot, which is reviewed by the county after the election. If the county determines that a voter did, in fact, already cast a mail ballot, the voter's provisional ballot will not be counted.",

            "a": "No. Many voter education and get-out-the-vote organizations send mail ballot information and applications to Pennsylvania voters. For that reason, you may receive multiple applications. Returning more than one application will result in additional workload for the election staff in your county office, but you will still be sent only one ballot. In addition, voters have reported receiving mail ballots even though they did not apply for them. In nearly all cases, these voters opted to be added to the annual mail ballot list\u00a0when they applied for a mail ballot for the primary. Opting into this list means that your county will send you a ballot for all elections during that calendar year.If you would like to receive a mail ballot, the Department of State recommends using the official absentee or mail-in ballot application.",

Unlike other states, state law in Pennsylvania prevents counties from even beginning to open ballots until 7 a.m. on Election Day \u2013 when those same election officials are managing in-person voting at more than 9,100 polling places. That law can only be changed if the Pennsylvania legislature sends a bill to the Governor\u2019s desk to allow counties to open mail ballot envelopes, flatten the ballots, and prepare them to be tallied BEFORE Election Day as most other states already allow. While we know there may be an eagerness to predict the outcomes, counties a reprioritizing accuracy and security as they count ballots.
