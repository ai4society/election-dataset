Displaced voters: If you were involuntarily displaced to a new parish or state due to a gubernatorially declared emergency, but want to remain registered to vote at your pre-emergency address, you may remain registered there if you have not changed your registration address or filed a homestead exemption on a different residence. You should provide a mailing address, if different from your pre-emergency residence address, to your registrar of voters to remain an active voter.

If you claim a homestead exemption then you must use your homestead exemption address:  however, if you do not claim homestead exemption and reside at more than one place in the state with an intention to reside there indefinitely, you may register only at one of the places at which you reside. There is a homestead exception in the law for persons who reside in a nursing home, as defined in La R.S. 40:2009.2, or in a veterans' home operated by the state or federal government.

Failure to update your residential address may result in an inactive registration status. Inactive voters must verify their residential addresses prior to voting, which may be done on Election Day at the precinct, in person at the registrar's office, online or by mail through a voter registration application.

If you do not have any of these, you may bring a copy of a current and valid photo identification, a copy of a current utility bill, bank statement, government check or government document that includes your name and address.  If registering at a mandated site, no further proof of identification is required other than whatever proof is required for services received that you have applied for at the public agency. Louisiana mails a verification mailing card to verify the address you have provided when registering by mail.

If you move, update your address with your registrar of voters online, by mail or in person.    Annually the registrar conducts a canvass by submitting your residence address to the U.S. Postal Service for verification.  If your residence address has changed, you will be mailed an Address Confirmation Card.  If you do not return the address confirmation card, you will be placed on inactive status. You can activate your status by updating your residence address online, by mail or in person either on Election Day before voting or at the Registrar of Voters Office.  If you do not update your address and do not vote for a two year period which includes two federal general elections, you may be canceled.

Louisiana law allows you to vote in your old parish for 3 months or until you register in your new parish, whichever occurs first.  You can register online, in person or by mail.

There are specific reasons listed below that qualify you to vote by mail. You can submit an application requesting a mail ballot through our online system or you may print and mail an application directly to your registrar of voters.  GENERAL APPLICATION QUALIFICATIONS (REASONS TO APPLY)  Senior Citizen: If you are 65 years of age or older you may apply through a General Application and, once accepted by the registrar of voters, vote absentee. You may apply for one election or you may apply to automatically receive an absentee ballot for all upcoming elections. Once you have opted in to automatically receive absentee ballots, you may opt out at any time by submitting an Absentee Program Opt-Out Form or your own written request to your parish Registrar of Voters. You will be removed from the Absentee Program automatically if any ballot mailed to you is returned to the registrar as undeliverable. Beginning in 2029, senior citizens enrolled in the absentee program will need to reapply every four (4) years. Temporarily Absent: If you will be temporarily outside your parish both during the early voting period and on election day, or expect to be, you may apply through a General Application and, once accepted by the registrar of voters, vote absentee. Any person who requests an absentee ballot be mailed to an address within the parish must indicate on the application the dates that they will be absent from the parish. Offshore: If you work or expect to be offshore working during the early voting period and on election day, you may apply through a General Application and, once accepted by the registrar of voters, vote absentee. Nursing Home: If you reside in a nursing home, veterans' home or a hospital for an extended stay for a physical disability and are unable to vote in person during early voting or at the polls on election day, you may apply through a General Application and enroll in the nursing home early voting program. Once accepted by the registrar of voters, the registrar or a deputy registrar will go to your home facility during a period of a week prior to the beginning of early voting through the last day of early voting. The registrar of voters will bring either a paper ballot or a portable voting machine and guide you through the process of casting your vote. Higher Education: If you are a student, instructor or professor located and living outside of your parish of registration, or the spouse/dependent thereof, you may apply through a General Application and, once accepted by the registrar of voters, vote absentee.

Involuntary Confinement: If you are involuntarily confined in an institution for mental treatment outside your parish of registration and you are not interdicted and not judicially declared incompetent, you may apply through a General Application and, once accepted by the registrar of voters, vote by absentee. Hospitalized: If you expect to be hospitalized on election day and did not have knowledge of the hospitalization until after the time for early voting had expired; or you were hospitalized during the time for early voting and you expect to be hospitalized on election day; or you were either hospitalized or restricted to bed by your physician during early voting and on election day, you may apply through a General Application and, once accepted by the registrar of voters, vote absentee. Incarcerated: If you are incarcerated or expect to be incarcerated in an institution inside or outside of your parish of registration and you are not under an order of imprisonment for conviction of a felony, you may apply through a General Application and, once accepted by the registrar of voters, vote absentee.

Juror: If you will be sequestered on the day of the election, you may apply through a General Application and, once accepted by the registrar of voters, vote absentee. DISABLED APPLICATION QUALIFICATIONS (REASONS TO APPLY)  Physical Disability: If you are physically disabled, you may apply through the Disabled Application and if not enrolled, enroll in the disability program. Once accepted by the registrar of voters, you may request a ballot for one election or you may request to automatically receive an absentee ballot for all upcoming elections.  Once you have opted in to automatically receive absentee ballots, you may opt out at any time by submitting an Absentee Program Opt-Out Form or your own written request to your parish Registrar of Voters. You will be removed from the Absentee Program automatically if any ballot mailed to you is returned to the registrar as undeliverable.  If you have not previously provided proof of disability to your parish registrar of voters, one of the following must be submitted along with your application:  a voter registration application requesting assistance in voting; a copy of a mobility impaired identification card issued by the Office of Motor Vehicles; a copy of social security disability benefits, veterans disability benefits, paratransit services, benefits from the Office for Citizens with Developmental Disabilities or benefits from Louisiana Rehabilitation Services; or a letter from a physician, optometrist, physician assistant or nurse practitioner certifying your disability.

Homebound: If you are homebound and cannot vote without assistance, you may apply through the Disabled Application and, if not enrolled, enroll in the disability program. If you are disabled and homebound and are voting for the first time, your proof of disability must be a physician's letter certifying that you are homebound to exempt you from law that requires that you either register or vote for the first time in person. Otherwise, you may provide proof of disability through any of the documents listed above.",

You are allowed by law six minutes to cast your vote, or 20 minutes if entitled to assistance or using the audio voting ballot. If the ballot is lengthy or if it contains complex propositions or constitutional amendments, the commissioners may allocate additional time in an equitable manner.  To vote on the machine, you must select a candidate of your choice or select YES or NO for a proposition by pressing the box to the right of the candidate's name or next to the YES or NO for a proposition. A green x will appear to the left of the box indicating your selection and the green header light for the office or proposition will turn off.  To change your selection, press the box again. The green x will disappear, the green header light for the candidate or proposition will light back up and you may make a new selection.  If at any time during voting, you do not understand how to operate the voting machine or you do not believe the voting machine is allowing you to vote on the offices that you are eligible to vote on, step out and notify a commissioner.  You must notify a commissioner before you press the CAST VOTE button. Once you have pressed CAST VOTE, button, your vote has been cast and you may not vote again.  The CAST VOTE button is a orange button at the bottom right hand side of the voting machine.  Once you have finished voting, part the curtains with your hands and exit the voting booth.

The commissioner can call the registrar of voters or the secretary of state for assistance.  If there was an error, the voter may be authorized to vote by completion of the Precinct Register Correction (\"PRC\") form.  The voter may just be at the wrong precinct.  The commissioner can assist the voter by looking up their precinct information on either the secretary of state's GeauxVote app or through a look up voter registration list that may be provided by the clerk of court's office in some polling places for this purpose only on Election Day.  After completion of a PRC form, the voter signs and then the voter may vote on the voting machine.  If a federal election, the voter would not be a provisional voter and therefore votes on the voting machine.  If there was no error and the person cannot be found at any other precinct in the state and it is a federal election, the person can vote a paper provisional ballot.",

There are many variations of DREs because lots of companies are inventing new ones, and many cities, counties and states are trying them out. Usually, after you have signed in, the poll workers will give you a card that you slide into a device to start your voting session.  Some of these devices will show all of the candidates and ballot choices on one big screen. Often, with these big screen devices you push a button next to the name of the candidate you want to vote for (or yes or no on a ballot measure). On other DREs, the screen is set up to show pages. On each screen or page, there will probably be one thing to vote on. For example, on one screen or page, you might vote for president. Then you might move to the next page to vote for senator. Often these small-screen devices have a touch screen, where you touch the screen next to the name of the person you want to vote for. Other devices have a key pad. And some have a keyboard, so you can write in the name of someone you want to vote for.  You let the system know you are finished voting by pushing a button, touching the screen or entering something on a keypad.  You can learn more about voting systems by checking out the Elections Assistance Commission's (EAC) resource.",
