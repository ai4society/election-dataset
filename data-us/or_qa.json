            "a": "The Oregon Elections Division does not currently send text message alerts to Oregonians. Some counties offer ballot tracking so voters can be notified via text, phone, or email when your ballot is mailed and again when it has been accepted for counting. Any text message you receive about your voter registration status is not an official communication from the Oregon Elections Division.

            "a": "Vote-by-mail is a modern and secure way to vote that Oregonians have been using for more than 20 years. Oregon has been an all vote-by-mail state for twenty years. Voters' pamphlets and ballots are mailed to active registered voters two to three weeks before each statewide election. Voters can return ballots by mail or at any official drop box across the state.

            "a": "The postmark rule refers to a law passed in 2021 that allows ballots mailed* on Election Day to count even if they are received up to seven days after Election Day. Yes, you can mail your ballot on Election Day as long as it is picked up and postmarked by the post office that day. This improvement ensures that every vote cast on time gets counted. It may also delay the results of close races because it will take a few days for all the votes to be counted. *OAR 165-007-0045 requires ballots to \"have a postal indicator\" showing that the ballot was mailed on or before Election Day. Postal indicators, or postmarks, are applied to mail when they are processed at the post office.",

            "a": "Most political parties in Oregon choose to hold closed primaries. In a closed primary, only voters who are registered members of a party can vote for the candidates in that party's primary. For example, registered Democrats can vote in the Democratic primary for Governor but not in the Republican primary for Governor. Under Oregon law, political parties can choose to have open or closed primaries. The winners of primary contests from different parties typically face each other in the General Election. All registered voters can participate in the General Election. Many voters in Oregon are not registered with a political party. Check your registration status to see if you are registered as a member of a political party.",

We facilitate the production of the document, but the materials are submitted directly by candidates and are published as submitted.

            "q": "Why are \"independent\" or nonaffiliated candidates not on the primary election ballot?",
            "a": "Some candidates choose to not be affiliated with any political party. We call these nonaffiliated candidates, although they are commonly referred to by voters and the media as independent.* Primary elections are held by parties to determine their nominee for the General Election in November. Offices like Governor, U.S. Senator, or State Representative are examples of partisan offices that have primary elections. Since nonaffiliated candidates are not seeking a party nomination, they cannot participate in the primary. Some offices are also nonpartisan, which means no candidates run with partisan labels. For example, county commissioners and judicial races are nonpartisan races in Oregon. These races do appear on primary ballots. *Not to be confused with the Independent Party, which is a recognized minor political party in Oregon.",

Additionally, some counties offer ballot tracking so voters can be notified via text, phone or email when your ballot is mailed and again when it has been accepted for counting.

            "q": "How does Oregon keep my vote private?",
            "a": "Several important processes are implemented by each Oregon county to ensure that your ballot is secret. Ballot envelopes are designed to ensure your ballot is unreadable until it is opened and counted. Many counties use a return envelope that has a security weave printed inside, preventing information on the ballot from being visible to anyone while the envelope is in transit. Other counties provide an optional secrecy sleeve or envelope that uses the same type of weave. Either a return envelope with security weave, or a secrecy sleeve ensures the privacy of the ballot. Every county in Oregon has procedures in place to ensure that authorized election staff, working in bipartisan teams, cannot see voters' identifying information while opening return envelopes and separating the ballots. Each county has a specific workflow in place tailored to their building, equipment, and number of ballots typically returned. All workers are trained and take oaths to uphold the integrity of the elections process and protect voter privacy. The ballots - which contain no voter specific identifying information â€“ are tabulated only after they are separated from the return envelopes. Election officials verify all voters' eligibility prior to separating the ballots from the envelopes and accurately counting them.",

            "a": "Oregon takes many steps to protect the integrity of election results. Visit our Election Integrity page for even more details. At each step in the process, we're working to ensure trusted results. Accurate voter registration: The Elections Division regularly sends updated voter registration lists to remove deceased people, people who have moved, and other changes that impact eligibility to county election offices. Oregon is a member of the Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC), a national data sharing system that ensures sharing of up-to-date voter registration information across states. Oregon is a member of the National Change of Address, a system that provides a secure dataset of individuals and families that have filed a change-of-address with the U.S. Postal Service. These reports are shared to counties monthly to ensure up-to-date information. Similarly, the state receives information from the Oregon Health Authority and other state agencies that is regularly shared to complement national information. The DMV and Elections Division share information daily to reflect automatic and online voter registration information. This year-round, widely sourced information sharing ensures that when we mail ballots, they go to an accurate list. Preventing fraudulent voting: Oregon elections are secure and protected against voter fraud in all but exceedingly rare instances. Elections officials take many steps to protect the integrity of our elections. Signature verification, unique barcodes, paper material that cannot be replicated, and other security procedures are in place across the state. Transparency: Voters are welcome to observe the ballot counting process, test of voting machines before elections, and signature verification at election offices across Oregon. Post-election review: All counties conduct hand recounts after statewide elections. These recounts are available to the public. Find out more at Oregonvotes.gov/integrity.",

It's uncommon for a voter to receive more than one ballot. Sometimes it does happen when a voter's information changes shortly before or after ballots are mailed.
