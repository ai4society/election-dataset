A \"Sip-N-Puff\" is also available for those voters with limited hand dexterity.\n\nES&S DS200: a portable electronic voting system that uses an optical scanner to read marked paper ballots and tally the results. These results are tabulated at the polling place and notifications are sent out immediately of any voting errors.\n\nES&S Automark: a voting machine designed for those that are blind, vision impaired, or another visual disability that would make it hard or impossible for them to make a ballot. Furthermore, the machine provides language assistance to those who speak English as a secondary language or for those who have reading difficulties. This machine is also equipped with the \"Sip-N-Puff\" voting device.\n\nYou can learn more about voting systems by checking out the voting machine summary of the New York State Board of Elections.",
